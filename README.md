# HeadFirstCSharpDogRacingGame
This repository contains the files for the head-first C# task: Dog racing game.

Here's how to go about the files:

You can download the '.exe' to see how the game works. It is adapted from the book "Head First C#"
You can also download the solution and the project folders to see the codes I used to create the game.


This project implements the basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming Using Csharp

The project was created about three months ago and was made available on 7th December, 2021.

Playing the game:

the bame is best enjoyed when you place a bet. To place a bet:
Select a user, select the dog, and the amount you want to place, then click place bet.
Invite your friends to also bet then click Race.

Race continues for as long as you still have money to stake.
If you run out of cash, then you can't bet

When you are done playing, click Exit
Or reset bets for everyone and play again
